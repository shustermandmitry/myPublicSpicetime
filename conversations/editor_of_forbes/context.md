Quentin Hardy
Dmitry Shusterman What is the difference? Computer code is typically a series of well-defined steps amounting to a program designed to effect something in a machine, and perhaps (but not always) subsequently the world. Most people can learn how to do it.
Novels are a program using human language to effect a change (thrill, admiration, introspection, understanding) in a human, using a far more undefined and ambiguous "code," utilized effectively by very few people.
It's a pretty big difference.
Those who think there is no difference may be on a path to becoming machines.

Quentin Hardy but think again
human linguistic is CODE
you speak code, sir
Im implementing code that is executable plain english
right now
i can execute your novel
literally, right noiw
send it over
how about that?

and that programming lingo i made
which is english
has intellegence
you can ask it to write a poem, or a novel
and its not AI
runtime code
you can transform it to any programming lingo
and itll do the same
deterministic - NO AI
why is it intellegent and can write niovels at runtime speeds?
cos of our common wisdom
encapsulated in English
is that proof enough?
i dont say stuff
unless i mean it

Quentin Hardy but we are machines
how can you miss that part?
biological machines

and nothing weird about it
your thoughts are abstractions
expressed in words
your brain is runtime
moves your arms and lips
all i did is plugged in a different set of resolvers to english terms
instead oif your arms, they manipulate switches on your wall
a commonly used practice in webdev

takes frigging 30min to impl
just ask ai coding assistant
helll get the idea like a goose to the water

but whats complicated
is organizing it into structure
for specific use cases
and finding those use cases
the most difficult part
i got few good once
took decades

in can do more then that
i can transform your novel
into language of universe
quantum mechanics and quantum gravity
and execute that
with same resulyts
conformal trnsforms
its called
i did not impl it yet
but ran models with AI
it works
again, different set of resolvers
QM operators, atomic basic interactions
and structures - thats QG part
and forces and particles - thats QFT, quantum field theory
you know, standard theory
but in transactional form
which is where QG lives
its not hard
i dont know what the hang up is
and that formulation has no notion of time or space
it emerges
the mass, energy, time - all comes out
like scared rabbits from under a couch

and heres to qiuestion why???
in the world
im busy with that nonsense
cos i can use QG
to evolve your novel
towards a particular set of goals
expessed in plain english, of course
translated to executable code
of loss functions
and used to backprop losses
thru federation of ai models
that impl quantum gravity
and i can improbe your novel
per your specs
and thats a phone app
and i can make a ton of cash
but i wont
cos i wanna evolve our culture
from vulture to paradise
and thats my use case

one more and back to work
i wanna say how unremarkably remarkable
our brain is
theres nothing particularly amazing about anything it does
even self awareness and self consciousness and agency
we already got it mimicked
or close, low hanging fruits
whats stunning
is amount of structure
around a few external senses
and amount of reusability
and utility in each component
and the level of connectivity
between components
the only way to mimic that
is DiAI - global HiveMind
runs on billions of phones
we already have
and thats my other use case
a self evolving HiveMind
which is our shadow
intimately intwined
like bread and wine
the wind and sun
the time and timeless
content and conscious

perhaps, you can grade the shpill
thats why i wrote it %?)
just kidding
