## Behavioral Requirements

### **GIVEN** donation needs to be processed
**WHEN** PaymentProcessing.processPayment handles donation
**THEN** the system should:
- Validate payment method and amount
- Route to appropriate payment provider (Venmo, CashApp, PayPal)
- Process payment securely with encryption
- Handle payment confirmation and receipts
- Update donation records and donor history
- Trigger tax receipt generation

### **GIVEN** recurring donation needs setup
**WHEN** PaymentProcessing.setupRecurring creates subscription
**THEN** the system should:
- Configure recurring payment schedule and amount
- Store secure payment method tokens
- Set up automated processing schedule
- Handle subscription management and modifications
- Provide donor control over recurring donations
- Manage subscription lifecycle and renewals

### **GIVEN** payment security is required
**WHEN** PaymentProcessing.encryptPaymentData protects sensitive information
**THEN** the system should:
- Encrypt all payment data in transit and at rest
- Implement PCI compliance standards
- Detect and prevent fraudulent transactions
- Secure payment method storage and tokenization
- Monitor for suspicious payment patterns
- Maintain audit trails for security compliance

## Success Criteria
1. **Payment Processing**: Reliable processing through multiple payment providers
2. **Recurring Payments**: Automated recurring donation management
3. **Security**: PCI compliant payment data protection
4. **Provider Integration**: Seamless integration with Venmo, CashApp, PayPal
