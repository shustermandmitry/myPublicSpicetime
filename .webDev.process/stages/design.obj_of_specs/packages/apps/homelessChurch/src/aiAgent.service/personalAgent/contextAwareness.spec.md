# Context Awareness - Specification

## Abstract
**What it does**: Provides context awareness capabilities for AI agents including church context analysis, user context tracking, and situational awareness.

## API Reference
```typescript
const ContextAwarenessAPI = z.object({
  // Context Analysis
  analyzeCurrentContext: z.function(),
  updateContextState: z.function(),
  trackContextChanges: z.function(),
  
  // Church Context
  analyzeChurchContext: z.function(),
  trackChurchActivities: z.function(),
  understandChurchCulture: z.function(),
  
  // User Context
  trackUserBehavior: z.function(),
  analyzeUserState: z.function(),
  predictUserNeeds: z.function(),
  
  // Situational Awareness
  assessSituation: z.function(),
  identifyPriorities: z.function(),
  adaptToSituation: z.function()
});
```

## Behavioral Requirements

### **GIVEN** agent needs to understand current context
**WHEN** ContextAwareness.analyzeCurrentContext processes environment
**THEN** the system should:
- Analyze current church activities and events
- Understand user's current task and priorities
- Assess time context (service times, meetings, deadlines)
- Identify relevant people and relationships
- Track environmental factors affecting decisions
- Maintain real-time context awareness

### **GIVEN** agent needs church-specific understanding
**WHEN** ContextAwareness.analyzeChurchContext processes church environment
**THEN** the system should:
- Understand church calendar and seasonal activities
- Track ongoing projects and initiatives
- Analyze church culture and communication patterns
- Identify key relationships and hierarchies
- Monitor church-specific priorities and values
- Adapt responses to church context and traditions

### **GIVEN** agent needs to track user behavior
**WHEN** ContextAwareness.trackUserBehavior monitors user patterns
**THEN** the system should:
- Track user work patterns and preferences
- Monitor task completion styles and approaches
- Analyze communication patterns and timing
- Identify stress indicators and workload patterns
- Predict user needs based on behavior history
- Adapt assistance timing and approach accordingly

### **GIVEN** agent needs situational awareness
**WHEN** ContextAwareness.assessSituation evaluates current situation
**THEN** the system should:
- Identify urgent vs. routine situations
- Assess complexity and resource requirements
- Understand stakeholder involvement and impact
- Evaluate time sensitivity and deadlines
- Determine appropriate response level and approach
- Prioritize actions based on situational factors

## Success Criteria
1. **Real-Time Awareness**: Current and accurate understanding of context
2. **Church Integration**: Deep understanding of church environment and culture
3. **User Adaptation**: Effective tracking and prediction of user needs
4. **Situational Response**: Appropriate responses based on situational assessment
