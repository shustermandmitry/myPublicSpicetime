# Agent Memory - Specification

## Abstract
**What it does**: Manages agent memory storage, retrieval, and organization for personal AI assistants, including short-term, long-term, and episodic memory.

## API Reference
```typescript
const AgentMemoryAPI = z.object({
  // Memory Storage
  storeShortTermMemory: z.function(),
  storeLongTermMemory: z.function(),
  storeEpisodicMemory: z.function(),
  
  // Memory Retrieval
  retrieveRecentMemories: z.function(),
  searchMemories: z.function(),
  getRelatedMemories: z.function(),
  
  // Memory Management
  consolidateMemories: z.function(),
  forgetOldMemories: z.function(),
  organizeMemories: z.function(),
  
  // Memory Analysis
  analyzeMemoryPatterns: z.function(),
  extractInsights: z.function(),
  identifyTrends: z.function()
});
```

## Behavioral Requirements

### **GIVEN** agent needs to store different types of memories
**WHEN** AgentMemory.storeShortTermMemory saves immediate context
**THEN** the system should:
- Store current conversation context and recent interactions
- Maintain working memory for ongoing tasks
- Track immediate user preferences and state
- Enable quick access to recent information
- Automatically expire short-term memories after time limit
- Promote important short-term memories to long-term storage

### **GIVEN** agent needs to remember long-term information
**WHEN** AgentMemory.storeLongTermMemory saves persistent data
**THEN** the system should:
- Store user preferences and behavioral patterns
- Maintain knowledge about church procedures and policies
- Remember successful task completion strategies
- Save important relationship and context information
- Organize memories by relevance and importance
- Enable efficient search and retrieval of stored information

### **GIVEN** agent needs to recall specific experiences
**WHEN** AgentMemory.storeEpisodicMemory saves event details
**THEN** the system should:
- Record specific interactions and their outcomes
- Store contextual details about when and where events occurred
- Maintain timeline of agent experiences and learning
- Enable recall of similar past situations
- Support pattern recognition across episodes
- Facilitate learning from past successes and failures

### **GIVEN** agent needs to find relevant memories
**WHEN** AgentMemory.searchMemories looks for information
**THEN** the system should:
- Search across all memory types using keywords and concepts
- Rank results by relevance and recency
- Provide contextual information with search results
- Enable semantic search for related concepts
- Support fuzzy matching for partial information
- Return results quickly for real-time assistance

## Success Criteria
1. **Memory Types**: Effective management of short-term, long-term, and episodic memory
2. **Fast Retrieval**: Quick access to relevant memories during interactions
3. **Memory Organization**: Efficient organization and consolidation of stored information
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Ability to identify patterns and trends in memory data
