## Behavioral Requirements

### **GIVEN** agent receives feedback on performance
**WHEN** AgentLearning.processFeedback analyzes user feedback
**THEN** the system should:
- Analyze positive and negative feedback patterns
- Identify specific behaviors that led to outcomes
- Update behavior weights based on feedback quality
- Adjust future response strategies accordingly
- Maintain learning history for trend analysis
- Enable continuous improvement through feedback loops

### **GIVEN** agent needs to adapt to user preferences
**WHEN** AgentLearning.adaptBehavior modifies agent responses
**THEN** the system should:
- Learn user communication preferences and style
- Adapt task execution approaches based on success rates
- Personalize recommendations and suggestions
- Adjust personality expression to match user expectations
- Maintain consistency while enabling adaptation
- Balance personalization with general effectiveness

### **GIVEN** agent encounters new situations
**WHEN** AgentLearning.reinforcementLearning processes experiences
**THEN** the system should:
- Learn from trial and error in task execution
- Develop strategies for handling similar situations
- Optimize decision-making through reward signals
- Build confidence in successful approaches
- Explore new strategies while exploiting known successes
- Enable autonomous improvement without explicit training

### **GIVEN** agent needs to learn from patterns
**WHEN** AgentLearning.unsupervisedLearning discovers insights
**THEN** the system should:
- Identify patterns in user behavior and preferences
- Discover hidden relationships in church data
- Cluster similar situations and responses
- Extract insights from interaction history
- Enable proactive assistance based on patterns
- Improve context understanding through pattern recognition

## Success Criteria
1. **Continuous Learning**: Ongoing improvement through experience and feedback
2. **Adaptation**: Effective personalization to individual user preferences
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Discovery of useful patterns in behavior and data
4. **Performance Optimization**: Measurable improvement in task success rates
