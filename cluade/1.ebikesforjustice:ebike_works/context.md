## from tgram chat with Douglas
i just built a kick ass mid drive for $600 total and can sell it for prbly$1000 to 1500 its a custom bilt monster
and there are deals like that all over the place here
and everywhere
this trek, converted is 2k, i bet
ill build a fancy ecommerce site, like pop it up in minutes
we have a tgram builder ready to go

and thats a solid enterprise, scalable
so, wanna join in
ill see how the sales go here
but its a super strong market here
for these kinda bikes
now add custom controllers
and really unique custom builds
no one can match it
they all doing stupid hub drives
mopeds with pedals

you can build a few and we can sell it here
well get a brand going
and, of course, i have the next phase with etrailers and all kinda contramptions that will blow peoples mind
i dont have to have a partner
but a good friend
is always welcome
I found it near impossible to sell a used e-bike myself. Where are pics of yours? Iâ€™m
let me finish it. Im still waiting on a few minor parts
I thinkthe key is to brand the operation
it has to offer not just a bike for sale
but a value beyond it, an oraganization with persistence and purpose and process, and with presence and a face behind it, and a story
Theres a huge demand, but people are burned by unscrupulous dealers on fb marketplace and even craigslist.
They rather shop at legit places, as i described
So, we have to create that kinda entety
And im sure itll start selling.
I think it should be beyond the sales
It should be coaching and service and customization and community
and a clear value proposition, not just a set price, at some arbitrary ridiculous price, where no one knows any context of that price.
there has to be a face behind venture, history of bike, history of the build, purpose of build
that purpose of build defines capabilities and the specialty of the bike
There are, trail mtb - full and hardtail suspension
commuters - high speed, hill climbers, hybrids
road trip bikes, crossbikes
then another classification of mid and hub drives and single and duel hubs
and there are a few vendors of motors
and theres customization of controllers, but not for all motor vendors
and when you get there, thats a whole specialized universe

People dont have inclination, capacity, time to get into it and design what they need
Thats the value we can offer - build to your peurpose, tell us how you will use it, we will provide options and explain and work with you till design is awsome, then we will source the parts, consult with you on prices of options
and we will not charge double on every part - we charge for service
and we use AI to do all that - and send them ai artifacts, or letm join a live Claud chat
and later my own interface -- we will personalize it
they will have an agent helping them - a phone app
and we standing behind - ready to impl the design
its a franchising operation

But ill try to sell mine and build another one and see what strategies work
ill build a website, like a custom build ebikes, list theoptions and services
offer a few ready to go, and an interactive design service, and an education tutorials, on several bike types, and options

Its gotta be a package - and an ethical package, not a scam on fb marketplace
Then we can get $100/hr - not $2000/bike. Thats unethical
People pay $160/hr for labor, at a bike shop near me, and they are busy
ill get claude project going and invite you, if you into that
we disolved the company in Russia
and closed the team account - have new pro account
its dmitryshusterman@ebikesforjustice.com
ill forward to your email, as before

and well develope the whole thing there
its a simple project, and we have a site builder - a tgram miniapp
i already have a nonprofit, but we can start another one, just dont wanna deal with multiple paperwork streams
and we can get orders, for you or for me, as two technicians
bikes are hard and expensive to ship, so well prbly be physically localized in services and clients
and well connect it to the higher purpose - feeding the hungry, using ebikes to deliver meals to homeless and have a donation fund and donate part of their fee to the fund, but would take another company
claude will design legal structure
that bike was sold, too good of a deal
but we can convert peoples existing bikes
a much cleaner proposition - a $300-400 per bike on top of parts
and prvide educational and advisory service for selecting parts

then, there are awesome deals on frames on aliexpress - for all kinda bikes
we can custom build kick ass high tech ebikes
road bikes, cargo bikes, commuter bikes, pure mtb bikes
all custom, interactively built, per request, but a few ready to go
and i guarantee you - with the right approach and strategy, well be doing really good, not filfy rich, but i have no desire for that
