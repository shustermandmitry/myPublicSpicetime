### What's Covered by MIT License

- CAD files for adapter designs
- Arduino/ESP32 firmware source code
- Wiring diagrams and schematics
- Assembly and installation instructions
- Test procedures and validation methods

## Simple Revenue Streams

Rather than complex residual structures, focus on direct revenue streams that don't require enforcement:

### 1. Direct Component Sales

- **Core Components:** Sell complete kits and hard-to-source components
- **Custom Parts:** CNC-machined adapters that require special tooling
- **Premium Options:** Higher quality components than generic alternatives
- **Bundled Packages:** Convenience of complete, tested systems

### 2. Optional Support Model

- **Basic Support:** Free community forum support
- **Premium Support:** Paid direct support options
  - Installation assistance: $25-50/hour
  - Custom firmware modifications: $50-100
  - Troubleshooting help: $25-50/hour

### 3. Affiliate Marketing

- **Component Referrals:** Amazon/AliExpress affiliate links for generic parts
- **Tool Recommendations:** Affiliate links for recommended tools
- **Complementary Products:** Battery, display, accessory referrals

### 4. Value-Added Services

- **Custom Tuning:** Specialized firmware for specific needs
- **Installation Guides:** Premium detailed guides with videos
- **Testing Service:** Pre-tested, validated components

## Community Collaboration

Create a lightweight community structure that encourages contributions without bureaucracy:

### GitHub-Based Collaboration

- **Main Repository:** Core designs and code with MIT license
- **Issue Tracking:** Community reports bugs and requests features
- **Pull Requests:** Accept community improvements
- **Discussion Forums:** GitHub Discussions for technical talk

### Recognition System

Instead of complex progenitor structures, use a simpler recognition approach:

- **Contributors Page:** Acknowledge all contributors
- **Feature Attribution:** Credit creators of new features
- **Expert Directory:** List of knowledgeable community members

### Documentation Wiki

- **Installation Guides:** Community-editable installation instructions
- **Troubleshooting:** Growing database of solutions
- **Compatibility Database:** User-reported bike compatibility

## Commercial Use Guidelines

Simple, clear guidelines for commercial users of your designs:

### Attribution Requirements

- **Required:** Link to original project repository
- **Required:** Clear statement of MIT license usage
- **Encouraged:** Contribute improvements back to main repository

### Quality Standards (Recommended, Not Enforced)

- Testing recommendations for commercial producers
- Minimum safety standards
- Recommended warranty terms

### Community Marketplace

- Forum-based marketplace for small producers
- Optional quality certification program
- User reviews and ratings

## Path to Monetization for Others

Create clear paths for others to build businesses on your platform:

### Installation Specialists

- Local bike shops can offer installation services
- Individual experts can provide mobile installation
- Remote support specialists can assist DIYers

### Regional Producers

- Small machine shops can produce adapters locally
- Electronics specialists can offer pre-programmed controllers
- Customization experts can develop specialized firmware

### Value-Added Resellers

- Bundle your system with complementary products
- Create premium versions with higher-end components
- Develop specialized versions for specific bike types

## Practical Implementation

1. **GitHub Repository:**
   - Upload all designs, code, and documentation
   - Create clear contribution guidelines
   - Establish basic issue templates

2. **Simple Documentation:**
   - Installation guides (PDF/web)
   - Component sourcing guide
   - Troubleshooting FAQ

3. **Forum Presence:**
   - Endless-Sphere dedicated thread
   - Reddit r/ebikes information post
   - Facebook group for users

4. **Basic Website:**
   - Direct links to GitHub
   - Simple store for component sales
   - Installation guides and documentation

This approach creates a lean structure that enables community collaboration while maintaining clear revenue streams for you and creating business opportunities for others, all without complex legal or financial structures that would be difficult to implement and enforce.
