## New Addition: Security Agent Call Screening System

### **🆕 Phase 0: Proactive Call Protection (Priority Addition)**

#### **0.1 AI Security Agent - "Guardian"**
**Goal**: Intercept and screen all incoming calls to parents' phones to prevent social engineering

**Guardian Agent Capabilities:**
- **Caller Authentication**: Verify identity of unknown callers
- **Social Engineering Detection**: Identify phishing/scam attempts in real-time
- **Contextual Screening**: Use current threat context to assess call risk
- **Family Recognition**: Allow whitelisted family/medical contacts
- **Emergency Override**: Allow legitimate urgent calls through

**Guardian Interaction Flow:**
```
Incoming Call → Guardian Agent Answers
    ↓
Guardian: "Hello, this is the security screening service for this number.
           May I ask who's calling and the nature of your call?"
    ↓
Caller Response → AI Analysis
    ↓
Decision Tree:
├── ✅ SAFE: "One moment, I'll connect you"
├── 🟡 SUSPICIOUS: "I need to verify your identity first..."
├── 🔴 THREAT: "This number does not accept solicitation calls. Goodbye."
└── 🚨 SCAM: Log attempt + Block + Alert you
```

#### **0.2 Advanced Caller Analysis**
**Goal**: Real-time assessment of caller intent and threat level

**Analysis Components:**
- **Voice Pattern Recognition**: Detect robocalls and voice spoofing
- **Script Detection**: Identify common scam scripts in real-time
- **Urgency Analysis**: Flag artificial urgency tactics
- **Knowledge Probing**: Detect information gathering attempts
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Identify fear/pressure tactics

**Guardian AI Responses:**
```
// Example scam interaction
Scammer: "This is urgent! Your computer has viruses!"
Guardian: "I understand your concern. Can you provide your company's
           official verification number so the account holder can
           call you back through official channels?"

// Result: Forces scammer to provide verifiable info or hang up
```

#### **0.3 Integration with Google Voice System**
**Goal**: Seamless integration with existing phone security setup

**Technical Architecture:**
```
Incoming Call → Google Voice → Guardian Agent (AI) → Decision
                                      ↓
                               ┌─────────────────┐
                               │ SAFE: Forward   │ → Parents' Phone
                               │ SUSPICIOUS: Vet │ → Enhanced Screening
                               │ THREAT: Block   │ → Log & Alert
                               └─────────────────┘
                                      ↓
                            Real-time Alert → Your Phone
```

**Guardian Agent Phone Integration:**
- **VoIP Service**: Guardian runs on dedicated VoIP line
- **Call Forwarding**: Google Voice forwards to Guardian first
- **Selective Transfer**: Guardian forwards approved calls to parents
- **Call Recording**: Optional recording for threat analysis
- **Transcript Analysis**: Real-time conversation analysis

#### **0.4 Threat Intelligence Integration**
**Goal**: Use current threat context to inform call screening decisions

**Context-Aware Screening:**
- **Recent Malware Detection**: Higher suspicion during active threats
- **Banking Activity**: Extra scrutiny for financial-related calls
- **Tax Season**: Enhanced screening for IRS scams
- **Current Scam Trends**: Updated daily from threat intelligence feeds

**Dynamic Response Adaptation:**
```
If recent banking compromise detected:
    Guardian becomes more aggressive with financial calls
    "I notice there's been recent suspicious activity on financial
     accounts. For security, all financial calls are being routed
     through our verification process. Can you provide the official
     customer service number for your institution?"
```
