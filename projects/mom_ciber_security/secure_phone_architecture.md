## Security Architecture Components

### **1. Phone Security (Complete)**
**New iPhone with eSIM** - Clean hardware foundation
- **Verizon eSIM**: New private number for banking 2FA only
- **Google Voice Bridge**: Public-facing number that forwards calls
- **Jitterbug Isolation**: Old compromised phone kept as monitoring honeypot

**Three-Number System:**
- **Private Verizon Number**: Banking, secure accounts, your communication
- **Public Google Voice**: Family, friends, general business  
- **Legacy Jitterbug**: Isolated monitoring for threat intelligence

### **2. Browser Security (Ubuntu Scripts)**
**Isolated Browser Environments** - Complete separation of sensitive and regular browsing
- **üîí Secure Google**: New Google account for banking and sensitive sites
- **üè¶ Secure Banking**: Banking websites only with confirmation dialogs
- **Regular Firefox**: Non-sensitive browsing (social media, news, shopping)

**Implementation:**
- **Automated Setup Scripts**: One-command installation on Ubuntu
- **Desktop Icons**: Simple click-to-launch secure environments
- **Visual Cues**: Clear window titles and notifications prevent confusion

### **3. Credential Migration (Planned)**

- **Banking Refresh**: New usernames, passwords, email, phone for all financial accounts
- **Government Accounts**: Fresh SSA, IRS, Medicare accounts with secure credentials
- **Cooling-Off Period**: Cancel and re-subscribe to services with new identity

### **4. AI Threat Monitoring (Development)**
**Real-Time Security Monitoring** - AI-powered threat detection and response
- **MacBook-Based System**: Monitors parents' systems from your location
- **Local Phi-4 Model**: Privacy-first on-device threat analysis
- **Remote Claude Integration**: Cloud AI for complex threat investigation

## Browser Security Scripts Detail

### **For Tech-Savvy Caregiver (Alex)**

These scripts create a foolproof secure browsing environment that mom can't accidentally compromise:

### **setup-secure-browsers.sh** - Main Installation
**What it does:**
- Installs Chrome, Firefox, and security utilities
- Creates isolated Chrome profile (`.chrome-secure-google/`)
- Generates two desktop icons with different security purposes
- Sets up launch scripts with visual confirmations
- Configures proper file permissions and trust settings

**Why it's secure:**
- Completely separate browser profiles (zero data sharing)
- Visual confirmation dialogs prevent accidental mixing
- Custom window titles make it obvious which browser is active
- Automatic notifications when secure sessions start/end

**Installation:**
```bash
chmod +x setup-secure-browsers.sh
./setup-secure-browsers.sh
```

### **test-browser-isolation.sh** - Security Verification
**What it tests:**
- Browser profile separation (no shared data)
- Cross-contamination detection (banking bookmarks in wrong browser)
- Desktop icon functionality
- Required dependencies installation
- Custom security icon creation

**Use cases:**
- Verify initial installation worked correctly
- Monthly security checks to ensure isolation maintained
- Troubleshoot if icons stop working properly
- Confirm no accidental cross-browser contamination

### **create-security-icons.sh** - Visual Security
**What it creates:**
- Custom SVG icons for secure browsers (lock symbols, bank imagery)
- Visual distinction from regular browser icons
- Updates desktop files to use security-themed icons

**Why visual cues matter:**
- Mom instantly knows which browser she's using
- Prevents accidentally using wrong browser for sensitive activities
- Clear visual separation reduces user error

### **cleanup-secure-browsers.sh** - Emergency Reset
**What it removes:**
- All desktop security icons
- Secure browser launch scripts
- Custom security icons
- **Optionally**: Secure browser profile (ALL saved passwords)

**When to use:**
- Security compromise suspected
- Need to start over with fresh setup
- Browser isolation appears broken
- Troubleshooting major issues

## Security Benefits by Component

### **Phone Architecture Benefits**
- **Number Isolation**: Banking 2FA isolated from social/scam calls
- **Clean Hardware**: New iPhone eliminates existing malware
- **Communication Continuity**: Google Voice maintains family contact
- **Threat Intelligence**: Jitterbug monitoring reveals ongoing attacks

### **Browser Architecture Benefits**
- **Complete Isolation**: Banking passwords never touch regular browser
- **Visual Protection**: Impossible to accidentally mix browsers
- **Password Management**: Secure Google account handles all sensitive credentials
- **Foolproof Operation**: Mom can't break security even accidentally

### **Credential Architecture Benefits**
- **Break Compromise Chain**: New credentials eliminate existing access
- **Recovery Control**: You control password resets and 2FA
- **Account Isolation**: Banking separate from social/entertainment accounts
- **Fresh Start**: Clean slate eliminates unknown vulnerabilities

## Implementation Guide for Alex (Caregiver)

### **Immediate Actions (This Week)**
1. **Deploy Browser Scripts**:
   ```bash
   # On mom's Ubuntu system
   chmod +x *.sh
   ./setup-secure-browsers.sh
   ./test-browser-isolation.sh
   ```

2. **Verify Phone Setup**:
   - Confirm Verizon eSIM working
   - Test Google Voice forwarding
   - Ensure Jitterbug isolated (mobile data only)

3. **Begin Credential Migration**:
   - Set up secure Google account
   - Start with primary bank (Bank of America)
   - Update email/phone for banking accounts

### **Security Verification**
```bash
# Weekly security check
./test-browser-isolation.sh

# Look for these confirmations:
# ‚úÖ Secure profile directory exists
# ‚úÖ Profiles are separate  
# ‚úÖ No cross-contamination detected
# ‚úÖ Desktop icons ready
# ‚úÖ Security scripts ready
```

### **Troubleshooting Common Issues**
```bash
# Icons don't appear
killall nautilus && nautilus &

# Chrome not found
sudo apt install google-chrome-stable

# Scripts won't run
chmod +x *.sh

# Reset everything
./cleanup-secure-browsers.sh  # Use with caution
```

### **Mom's Daily Workflow**
1. **Banking**: Click üè¶ Secure Banking icon ‚Üí Confirmation dialog ‚Üí Bank of America opens
2. **Sensitive sites**: Click üîí Secure Google icon ‚Üí Google sign-in ‚Üí Navigate to healthcare/government/insurance
3. **Regular browsing**: Use Firefox icon ‚Üí Social media, news, entertainment
4. **Emergency**: Call you immediately for any suspicious activity

- **Isolated Browsers**: Separate secure/regular activity for behavior analysis  
- **Jitterbug Monitoring**: Honeypot data reveals ongoing attack patterns
- **System Logs**: Ubuntu system monitoring for intrusion detection

### **AI Response Capabilities**
- **Threat Detection**: Analyze logs for malware, intrusion attempts, unusual activity
- **Automatic Containment**: Isolate threats, block suspicious connections
- **Alert Generation**: Notify you immediately of critical security events
- **Investigation Guidance**: AI-powered analysis of security incidents
- **Remote Actions**: Execute approved security responses via MCP server

### **Mobile Access**
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Monitor security status from your phone
- **Alert Notifications**: Critical threats push to your mobile immediately
- **Remote Authorization**: Approve security actions when away from MacBook
- **Chat Interface**: Ask AI about security status, get investigation guidance

This integrated approach provides **defense in depth**: clean hardware ‚Üí isolated software ‚Üí fresh credentials ‚Üí AI monitoring ‚Üí immediate response. Each layer protects against different attack vectors while maintaining usability for mom.
