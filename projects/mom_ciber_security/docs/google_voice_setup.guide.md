## What Google Voice Accomplishes

### **Communication Architecture**
```
Family/Friends/Business
        ‚Üì
Google Voice Number (Public)
        ‚Üì
    Forwards to:
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Mom's new iPhone (secure)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Mom's old Jitterbug (monitored)
```

### **Security Benefits**
- **Number portability**: Can easily move between devices
- **Call screening**: Built-in spam protection
- **Number isolation**: Real iPhone number stays private
- **Monitoring capability**: See all incoming calls/texts
- **Evidence collection**: Log suspicious communications

---

## Prerequisites

### **Before Starting**
- **Mom's existing Google account** (NOT the new secure one)
- **Mom's new iPhone** with Verizon eSIM activated
- **Mom's old Jitterbug** (temporarily active for forwarding)
- **Your phone number** for emergency forwarding
- **Computer access** for initial setup

### **Account Strategy**
**Important**: Use mom's **regular** Google account for Google Voice:
- **NOT the secure banking Google account**
- Use the Gmail she already knows and uses
- This keeps Google Voice separate from banking activities

---

## Step 1: Google Voice Account Creation

### **Initial Setup**
1. **Go to Google Voice**: Open https://voice.google.com
2. **Sign in**: Use mom's existing Google account
3. **Choose number**: Select "Get a Google Voice number"
4. **Pick area code**: Choose mom's local area code or memorable number
5. **Verify identity**: Google may require phone verification

### **Number Selection Strategy**
**Options for Google Voice number:**
- **New memorable number**: Easy for mom to remember (like 555-MOM-HELP)
- **Transfer existing number**: Port mom's current Jitterbug number to Google Voice
- **Local area code**: Matches where mom lives for local recognition

### **Recommended: Transfer Existing Number**
If mom wants to keep her current phone number:
1. **Port Jitterbug number** to Google Voice
2. **Family keeps calling same number** they always have
3. **No confusion** about new numbers
4. **Seamless transition** for existing contacts

---

## Step 2: Forwarding Configuration

### **Basic Forwarding Setup**
1. **Go to Settings**: Click gear icon in Google Voice
2. **Go to "Linked numbers"**: Add forwarding destinations
3. **Add iPhone**: Enter mom's new Verizon eSIM number
4. **Add Jitterbug**: Enter mom's old Jitterbug number (temporarily)
5. **Add your phone**: Your number for emergency backup

### **Forwarding Rules Configuration**
```
Google Voice Number: (555) 123-4567
    ‚Üì
Forwards to:
‚úÖ Mom's iPhone: (555) 987-6543 (Primary)
‚úÖ Mom's Jitterbug: (555) 111-2222 (Temporary monitoring)
‚úÖ Your phone: (555) 999-8888 (Emergency backup)
```

### **Ring Settings**
- **Ring all phones simultaneously**: All phones ring at once
- **Ring time**: 25 seconds before voicemail
- **Voicemail**: Google Voice handles voicemail centrally

---

## Step 3: Mobile App Installation

### **iPhone Google Voice App**
1. **Download**: Install "Google Voice" from App Store
2. **Sign in**: Use mom's Google account
3. **Permissions**: Allow notifications, microphone, contacts
4. **Test calls**: Make test call to verify working

### **App Configuration**
```
Google Voice iPhone App Settings:
‚úÖ Notifications: On (for missed calls/texts)
‚úÖ Call forwarding: On (forwards to iPhone number)
‚úÖ Text forwarding: On (texts appear in app)
‚úÖ Voicemail transcription: On (easier to read)
‚úÖ Spam filtering: On (automatic spam blocking)
```

### **Jitterbug App (Temporary)**
- **Install Google Voice app** on Jitterbug if possible
- **Or use SMS forwarding** for text messages
- **Monitor all activity** on Jitterbug for security analysis

---

## Step 4: Advanced Spam Protection Strategy

### **Reality Check: Google Voice Limitations**
Google Voice has **basic** spam filtering, but it's not enough for mom's situation due to malware breach exposure:

**What GV blocks:**
- Known robocall numbers in Google's database
- Numbers marked as spam by many users
- Some obvious scam patterns

**What still gets through:**
- New scam numbers (not yet in database)
- Local number spoofing (appears local)
- Live scammers with real phones
- Rotating phone farms (constantly changing numbers)

**Result**: Mom will still get 50-70% of spam calls with GV alone

### **Multi-Layer Spam Protection (Recommended)**

#### **Layer 1: Verizon Call Filter (Network Level)**
```
Enable on Verizon Account:
‚úÖ Verizon Call Filter Plus (usually free with unlimited plans)
‚úÖ Blocks known scam numbers before they reach phone
‚úÖ Real-time database updates
‚úÖ Automatic spam/robocall detection
```

#### **Layer 2: Google Voice Ultra-Aggressive Settings**
```
Google Voice Configuration:
‚úÖ Screen ALL unknown callers (not just some)
‚úÖ Block international calls completely
‚úÖ Block premium rate numbers (900, etc.)
‚úÖ Require caller ID for all calls
‚úÖ Block calls with no caller ID
‚úÖ Send non-contacts directly to voicemail (no ringing)
```

#### **Layer 3: iPhone Spam Detection**
```
Install Additional Protection:
‚úÖ Truecaller app (excellent spam database)
‚úÖ OR Hiya app (alternative spam detection)
‚úÖ Enable in Settings ‚Üí Phone ‚Üí Call Blocking & Identification

iPhone Native Settings:
‚úÖ Settings ‚Üí Phone ‚Üí Silence Unknown Callers (ON)
‚úÖ Settings ‚Üí Phone ‚Üí Allow Calls From: Contacts Only
```

#### **Layer 4: Contact Whitelist Strategy**
```
Allow List (Only These Ring Through):
‚úÖ Your phone number (always)
‚úÖ Family members
‚úÖ Doctor's office  
‚úÖ Pharmacy
‚úÖ Known utilities (electric, gas companies)

Block Everything Else:
‚ùå Unknown numbers go straight to voicemail
‚ùå No ringing, no interruption
‚ùå Voicemail transcription shows legitimate calls
```

### **Call Screening Configuration**
```
Google Voice Call Screening Script:
"This call is being screened for security. 
Please state your name and reason for calling after the tone."

Results:
‚úÖ Legitimate callers: State their name
‚ùå Robocalls: Hang up immediately  
‚ùå Scammers: Usually hang up or give fake names
```

### **Time-Based Protection Rules**
```
Business Hours (9 AM - 6 PM):
- Family/contacts ring through immediately
- Doctor's office rings through (if in contacts)
- Unknown callers screened (must state name)

Evening (6 PM - 9 PM):  
- Only family/close contacts ring through
- Everything else ‚Üí voicemail

Night (9 PM - 8 AM):
- Only emergency contacts (your number)
- All other calls silenced completely
```

---

## Step 8: Security Monitoring and Threat Analysis

### **What You Can Monitor**
**Call logs:**
- **All incoming calls** to Google Voice number (blocked and allowed)
- **Spam call patterns** and frequency analysis
- **New attack numbers** targeting mom
- **Time patterns** of scam attempts

**Blocked spam analysis:**
- **Geographic origins** of spam calls
- **Number patterns** (sequential, spoofed local, etc.)
- **Call frequency** from same sources
- **Escalation patterns** (increasing call volume)

**Text message monitoring:**
- **All text messages** to Google Voice number
- **Phishing attempt detection** (malicious links)
- **Social engineering attempts** (urgent requests)
- **Scam evolution** (new techniques being tried)

### **Red Flags to Watch For**
```
Escalating Threat Patterns:
‚ö†Ô∏è Sudden increase in spam call volume
‚ö†Ô∏è Calls specifically targeting mom's interests/age
‚ö†Ô∏è Persistent calls from same number after blocking
‚ö†Ô∏è Sophisticated local number spoofing
‚ö†Ô∏è Calls claiming to be from her bank/doctor

Advanced Scam Indicators:
‚ö†Ô∏è Callers who know personal information about mom
‚ö†Ô∏è References to recent purchases or accounts
‚ö†Ô∏è Calls claiming to "verify" recent security changes
‚ö†Ô∏è Urgent demands for immediate action
‚ö†Ô∏è Requests to install remote access software
```

### **Evidence Collection**
**Document for threat analysis:**
- **Screenshot spam call logs** weekly
- **Save suspicious voicemail transcripts**
- **Record new scam techniques** being attempted
- **Track effectiveness** of blocking measures
- **Correlate with Jitterbug activity** (same attackers?)

### **Spam Pattern Analysis**
```
Weekly Review Questions:
1. How many spam calls blocked this week?
2. Are attackers trying new number patterns?
3. Any calls that bypassed all filters?
4. What time of day are most attacks?
5. Any correlation with mom's online activity?
6. Are scammers getting more sophisticated?
```

## Step 8: Advanced Configuration

### **Business Hours Settings**
```
Weekdays (9 AM - 6 PM):
- Ring all phones simultaneously
- Voicemail after 25 seconds

Evenings (6 PM - 9 PM):
- Ring all phones
- Shorter ring time (15 seconds)

Late Night (9 PM - 8 AM):
- Send directly to voicemail (unless in contacts)
- Emergency contacts can still ring through
```

### **Do Not Disturb Integration**
- **Sync with iPhone**: Honor iPhone's Do Not Disturb settings
- **Important callers**: Your number always rings through
- **Emergency bypass**: Family members can call twice to override
- **Weekend settings**: Different rules for weekends

### **International Call Blocking**
```
Security Settings:
‚úÖ Block international calls (unless family traveling)
‚úÖ Block premium rate numbers (900, etc.)
‚úÖ Block numbers with no caller ID
‚úÖ Require caller ID for all calls
```

---

## Step 9: Transition Timeline

### **Week 1: Parallel Operation**
- **Both phones active**: Jitterbug and iPhone both ring
- **Google Voice number**: Give to immediate family only
- **Monitor usage**: Make sure everything works correctly
- **Test all features**: Calls, texts, voicemail

### **Week 2-3: Contact Migration**
- **Update key contacts**: Medical, emergency, family
- **Service updates**: Banks, utilities, important services
- **Gradual transition**: People start using Google Voice number
- **Monitor patterns**: Watch for suspicious activity

### **Week 4+: Jitterbug Isolation**
- **Remove Jitterbug** from Google Voice forwarding
- **Keep active** for monitoring purposes only
- **Document activity**: Any calls/texts to old number
- **Analysis**: What attackers are still trying

---

## Step 10: Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Google Voice number not ringing iPhone:**
```bash
# Check forwarding settings
# Verify iPhone number entered correctly
# Test with direct call to iPhone number
# Check iPhone "Do Not Disturb" settings
```

**Poor call quality:**
```bash
# Use iPhone's regular phone app instead of GV app
# Check WiFi vs cellular connection quality
# Update Google Voice app
# Restart iPhone
```

**Texts not appearing:**
```bash
# Check Google Voice app notifications
# Verify SMS forwarding settings
# Update Google Voice app
# Check iPhone message filtering settings
```

**Voicemail not working:**
```bash
# Check Google Voice voicemail settings
# Verify greeting is recorded
# Test voicemail with known caller
# Check transcription settings
```

---

## Step 11: Integration with Overall Security

### **Banking Phone Strategy**
**Important**: Banking 2FA should use **Verizon eSIM number**, NOT Google Voice:
- **Bank of America 2FA**: Verizon eSIM number
- **Credit card 2FA**: Verizon eSIM number
- **Investment accounts**: Verizon eSIM number
- **Government accounts**: Verizon eSIM number

### **Why This Separation Matters**
- **Google Voice**: Public-facing, family communication
- **Verizon eSIM**: Private, secure, banking only
- **Attack surface**: Google Voice can be targeted, Verizon number stays hidden
- **Recovery control**: You control Verizon number recovery

### **Emergency Procedures**
**If Google Voice compromised:**
1. **Change Google account password** immediately
2. **Remove suspicious forwarding** numbers
3. **Check call/text logs** for unauthorized activity
4. **Notify family** of temporary number change
5. **Banking unaffected**: Still works on Verizon eSIM

**If iPhone lost/stolen:**
1. **Google Voice still works** on other devices
2. **Remove iPhone** from forwarding temporarily
3. **Add replacement phone** to forwarding
4. **Call history preserved** in Google Voice
5. **No communication interruption**

## Step 12: Spam Protection Results and Expectations

### **Expected Spam Reduction**
```
Before Multi-Layer Protection:
üìä Mom receives: 15-25 spam calls per day
üìä Stress level: High (constant interruption)

- **Quality of life**: Phone becomes useful tool, not source of harassment

### **Backup Plans**
**If mom misses important calls:**
- **Voicemail transcription** makes checking messages easy
- **Your number always rings through** for emergencies
- **Google Voice web interface** shows all activity
- **Can temporarily disable screening** if needed for expected calls

**If spam adapts and gets through:**
- **Additional apps** available (RoboKiller, etc.)
- **Carrier-level upgrades** (premium spam blocking)
- **Number change** as last resort (Google Voice makes this easy)
- **AI monitoring** will detect new attack patterns

This multi-layer approach transforms mom's phone from "constant spam target" to "secure family communication tool" while providing valuable intelligence about ongoing attacks.
