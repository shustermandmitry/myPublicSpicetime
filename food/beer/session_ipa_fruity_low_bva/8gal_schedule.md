No problem! You have plenty of good hops to work with. Let me adjust the schedule for your 7.5 gallon Session IPA:

**Current situation:** You only have 0.6 oz Cascade left

## Revised hop schedule with what you have:
```
**60 min:** 0.6 oz Cascade (use what you have for bittering)
**60 min:** 0.9 oz Chinook (add this for additional bittering - Chinook has good alpha acids)
**20 min:** 1 oz Mosaic (flavor - great citrus/tropical character)  
**15 min:** Irish moss
**10 min:** 0.5 oz crushed juniper berries
**5 min:** 1.5 oz Mosaic (aroma - amazing tropical/fruity notes)
**Dry hop:** 2 oz Mosaic (this will be incredible)
```

## Why this works great:
- **Cascade + Chinook** at 60 min gives excellent bittering
- **Mosaic** is fantastic for Session IPAs - intense tropical fruit flavors
- **More Mosaic** means more mango, passion fruit, berry notes
- **Still get your botanical complexity** from juniper and orange peel

Mosaic is actually a perfect substitution - many brewers prefer it to Cascade for fruit-forward IPAs. Your beer might turn out even better with this hop combination!

The Mosaic will pair beautifully with the orange peel too.
