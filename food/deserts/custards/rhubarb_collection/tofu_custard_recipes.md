## Pro Tips for Rhubarb Custards:

### Rhubarb Prep:
- Always cook rhubarb first - it's too fibrous raw
- Don't overcook - you want it soft but not mushy
- Taste after cooking and adjust sugar accordingly
- Red rhubarb gives better color than green

### Flavor Balance:
- **Pure rhubarb**: Most tart, needs more sugar or sweet milk
- **Rhubarb-strawberry**: Naturally balanced sweet-tart
- **Rhubarb-mango**: Tropical twist, very balanced

### Texture Notes:
- These will be slightly thicker due to cooked fruit
- Tapioca flour helps bind the fruit moisture
- Strain well to remove any remaining fiber pieces
- Will firm up more than fresh fruit versions

### Cardamom Usage:
- Pairs beautifully with rhubarb's tartness
- Use sparingly - it's potent
- Can omit from strawberry version if you prefer cleaner fruit flavor

### Color Results:
- **Pure rhubarb**: Pink to deep rose
- **Rhubarb-strawberry**: Beautiful coral pink
- **Rhubarb-mango**: Orange-pink swirl pattern

### Storage:
- These keep 3-4 days refrigerated
- Flavors meld and improve after first day
- Can be served slightly frozen for different texture
