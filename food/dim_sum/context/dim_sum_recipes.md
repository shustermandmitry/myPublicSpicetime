## Essential Techniques

### Pleating Dumplings
- **Half-moon style:** Fold wrapper in half, pleat one side only
- **Purse style:** Gather all edges to center and twist
- **Har gow style:** Create 12-18 small pleats along edge

### Steaming Tips
- Line steamer with parchment paper or cabbage leaves
- Don't overcrowd - leave space between items
- Bring water to boil before adding food
- Keep lid on during steaming
- Most items need 8-20 minutes depending on size

### Storage
- Uncooked dumplings can be frozen on trays, then stored in bags
- Steam frozen dumplings directly (add 2-3 extra minutes)
- Cooked dim sum best eaten immediately
- Sourdough buns can be made ahead and reheated - the flavor actually improves overnight
