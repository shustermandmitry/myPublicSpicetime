# Dim Sum Recipe Collection

*Collaborative recipe book for party planning*

## How This Works

Each recipe folder contains:
- **recipe.md** - Instructions and techniques
- **ingredients.md** - Detailed shopping and prep guide
- **votes.md** - Vote for recipes you want to make
- **commitments.md** - Claim ingredients to bring
- **expenses.md** - Track costs for expense splitting

## Quick Start for Party Planning

1. **[Read the guide](../HOW-TO-USE.md)** - 5-minute setup
2. **Browse recipes below** and vote in `votes.md` files
3. **Claim ingredients** in `commitments.md` files
4. **Track expenses** in `expenses.md` files (including personal stock)
5. **Party time!** ðŸ¥Ÿ

### Personal Stock & Compensation
- **List estimates** for items from your personal stock in `expenses.md`
- **We'll compensate** all costs - don't worry about bringing your own stuff
- **Leftovers shared** in doggy bags - whatever's not eaten gets divided up
- **Fair splitting** - all expenses divided evenly among attendees
