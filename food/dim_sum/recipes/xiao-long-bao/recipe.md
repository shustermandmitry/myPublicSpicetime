# Xiao Long Bao (Soup Dumplings)

*Delicate dumplings filled with pork and savory soup*

## Recipe
**Makes 20-25 pieces**

### Aspic (Gelatin Stock) Preparation
1. Heat 2 cups rich pork or chicken stock
2. Sprinkle gelatin over stock and stir until dissolved
3. Cool in refrigerator until completely set (2-3 hours)
4. Dice the set aspic into small cubes

### Filling Instructions
1. Mix ground pork with soy sauce, sesame oil, minced ginger, and green onion
2. Gently fold in the cold diced aspic - don't overmix
3. Keep filling cold until ready to use

### Assembly
1. Roll dumpling wrappers slightly thicker than usual (for strength)
2. Place 1 tablespoon filling in center
3. Pleat edges carefully with 18-20 pleats
4. Twist top to seal completely - no leaks allowed
5. Place each dumpling on individual parchment squares

### Cooking
Steam for 12-15 minutes. The aspic will melt into soup during steaming.

## Critical Tips
- Aspic must be completely cold when mixing
- Seal dumplings perfectly or soup will leak out
- Eat carefully - soup is very hot!
- Traditionally eaten by biting a small hole and sipping the soup first
