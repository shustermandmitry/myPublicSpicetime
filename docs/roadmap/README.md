# SpiceTime: Social Quantum Gravity Implementation

*Building the infrastructure for programmable culture and collective intelligence*

---

## What This Is

We're building technology that makes human wisdom directly executable. Not just better software—**programmable social reality** where communities can encode their values into systems that automatically create the world they want to live in.

## The Core Insight

Social systems exhibit quantum mechanical effects that can be measured, modeled, and optimized. By treating cultural behaviors as particles in a field, we can apply the mathematics of physics to create **ethical gravity**—systems that naturally pull society toward better outcomes.

## How It Works

- **Cultural Type System**: Identifies behavioral patterns (greedy, altruistic, collaborative) as measurable "particles"
- **HiveMind Network**: Personal AI agents that collectively measure and shape social reality
- **Ethical Optimization**: Feedback loops that reward positive behaviors and discourage harmful ones
- **Executable English**: Community wisdom written in plain language that becomes running code

## The Vision

Communities that can **program their own culture**. Neighborhoods that automatically share resources. Organizations that optimize for human flourishing. Economies that reward collaboration over competition.

Not through force or control, but through **intelligent systems** that make doing good more profitable and easier than doing harm.
