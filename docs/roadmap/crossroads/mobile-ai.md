## The Mobile Revolution: AI in Every Pocket

The future of artificial intelligence isn't in massive data centers controlled by corporationsâ€”it's in the smartphones already in everyone's pocket, working together as a **distributed collective intelligence** that serves communities rather than extracting from them.

This isn't just about making AI more accessible. It's about **democratizing intelligence** itself.
