# Local Runtime Architecture

*Running community systems on phones and local networks for autonomy and resilience*

---

## The Autonomy Imperative

Communities need technology they control, not technology that controls them. The local runtime architecture ensures that:
- **Community data stays in community hands**
- **Systems work without internet or corporate infrastructure**
- **Local decisions don't require external permission**
- **Communities can fork and modify their own systems**

This isn't just about privacyâ€”it's about **technological sovereignty**.
