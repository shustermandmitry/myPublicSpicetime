# Ethical Smart Contracts

*Automated fair compensation and resource allocation based on community values*

---

## Beyond Traditional Smart Contracts

Most smart contracts encode rigid rules that can't adapt to changing circumstances or community values. **Ethical smart contracts** are different—they embody community wisdom and evolve based on real-world outcomes.

These aren't just automated transactions. They're **programmable ethics** that ensure fairness, transparency, and community benefit in all economic interactions.

## The Fair Compensation Revolution

### Automatic Value Distribution

**Traditional Problem:**
- Value creators often don't benefit from their contributions
- Middlemen capture disproportionate value
- Complex attribution makes fair compensation difficult
- Manual tracking is expensive and error-prone

**Ethical Smart Contract Solution:**
Every contribution is automatically tracked and compensated based on:
- **Direct value creation** measured through community outcomes
- **Indirect contributions** like mentoring, organizing, and care work
- **Long-term impact** that becomes apparent over time
- **Community-defined fairness** criteria that reflect local values

### MIT License Hierarchy for Fair Attribution

**Contribution Tracking:**
```
Base Creator → gets percentage of all derivative value
Modifier → earns from improvements they add
Assembler → paid for integration and implementation
Educator → revenue share from knowledge transfer
Maintainer → compensation for ongoing support
```

**Automatic Revenue Flows:**
When someone benefits from community-created value:
1. **Smart contract identifies** all contributors in the value chain
2. **Calculates fair shares** based on contribution type and impact
3. **Distributes compensation** automatically without bureaucracy
4. **Updates attribution** as new contributions build on existing work
5. **Ensures sustainability** by reserving funds for maintenance and development

## Resource Allocation Algorithms

### Need-Based Distribution

**Community Resource Pools:**
Smart contracts manage shared resources based on:
- **Basic needs first**: Ensuring everyone has housing, food, healthcare, education
- **Contribution-based allocation**: Additional resources based on community contribution
- **Emergency reserves**: Automatic crisis response and mutual aid
- **Investment funds**: Community-controlled development and infrastructure

**Adaptive Algorithms:**
```english
Resource allocation should:
  ensure everyone has enough before anyone has excess
  reward contribution while supporting those who cannot contribute
  adapt to changing community needs and circumstances
  maintain reserves for emergencies and future investment
  respect individual autonomy while optimizing collective wellbeing
```

### Surplus Redistribution

**Abundance Sharing:**
When communities generate surplus value:
- **Individual prosperity** up to community-defined abundance thresholds
- **Collective investment** in shared infrastructure and capabilities
- **Network sharing** with communities that have greater needs
- **Future generations** through sustainable development and preservation

**Anti-Hoarding Mechanisms:**
- **Wealth caps** that redirect excess to community benefit
- **Use-it-or-lose-it** policies for underutilized resources
- **Circulation incentives** that reward sharing over accumulation
- **Community ownership** of essential infrastructure and services

## Governance Automation

### Democratic Decision Implementation

**Proposal to Execution Pipeline:**
1. **Community discussion** using natural language processing to identify consensus
2. **Formal proposal** creation with impact assessment and resource requirements
3. **Democratic voting** with various consensus mechanisms (majority, consensus, delegation)
4. **Automatic implementation** through smart contract execution
5. **Outcome tracking** and adjustment based on real-world results

**Adaptive Governance:**
Smart contracts that evolve based on:
- **Effectiveness measurement** of past decisions and their outcomes
- **Community satisfaction** with governance processes and results
- **Changing circumstances** that require new approaches
- **Learning from other communities** about successful governance innovations

### Conflict Resolution Automation

**Mediation Protocols:**
When disputes arise, smart contracts facilitate:
- **Automatic fact-finding** through data analysis and witness testimony
- **Mediation suggestions** based on community values and past successful resolutions
- **Escalation procedures** that involve broader community input when needed
- **Restorative justice** focused on healing relationships and preventing future conflicts

**Accountability Mechanisms:**
- **Transparent decision-making** with clear reasoning and evidence
- **Appeal processes** for decisions that seem unfair or incorrect
- **Community oversight** of automated systems and their outcomes
- **Override capabilities** for situations requiring human judgment

## Economic Democracy in Practice

### Worker Cooperative Automation

**Profit Sharing:**
Smart contracts automatically distribute business profits based on:
- **Labor contribution** measured through time, skill, and effort
- **Risk sharing** for those who invested time or resources in the business
- **Community impact** of the business on local wellbeing and sustainability
- **Democratic decisions** about profit distribution and reinvestment

**Decision Making:**
- **Stakeholder identification** for each business decision
- **Weighted voting** based on expertise and impact
- **Consensus building** through facilitated discussion and compromise
- **Implementation tracking** to ensure decisions are carried out effectively

### Community Investment Funds

**Collective Capital Formation:**
- **Member contributions** pooled for community development projects
- **External investment** with community control and benefit requirements
- **Revenue generation** through community-owned businesses and services
- **Reinvestment cycles** that compound community wealth over time

**Democratic Investment Decisions:**
- **Project proposals** evaluated for community benefit and sustainability
- **Risk assessment** with community input and expertise
- **Impact measurement** tracking social, economic, and environmental outcomes
- **Adaptive management** adjusting investments based on performance and changing needs

## Cross-Community Economics

### Inter-Community Trade

**Fair Exchange Protocols:**
Smart contracts facilitate trade between communities based on:
- **Mutual benefit** ensuring both communities gain from exchange
- **Sustainability requirements** preventing exploitation of people or environment
- **Cultural respect** honoring different community values and practices
- **Relationship building** that strengthens long-term cooperation

**Community Currency Integration:**
- **Local currencies** that keep wealth circulating within communities
- **Exchange mechanisms** for trade between different currency systems
- **Value stabilization** preventing speculation and manipulation
- **Democratic control** of monetary policy by community members

### Global Solidarity Networks

**Resource Sharing:**
Communities with abundance support those with greater needs through:
- **Surplus redistribution** of food, materials, and manufactured goods
- **Skill sharing** through remote education and consultation
- **Technology transfer** of successful innovations and best practices
- **Crisis response** mobilizing network-wide support during emergencies

**Collective Bargaining:**
- **Bulk purchasing** for better deals on essential goods and services
- **Shared infrastructure** for communication, computation, and logistics
- **Coordinated advocacy** for policy changes that benefit all communities
- **Knowledge commons** that accelerate innovation and problem-solving
