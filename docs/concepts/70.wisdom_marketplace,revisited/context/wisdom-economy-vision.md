# The Wisdom Economy: From Church to Everything

## The Pattern You've Discovered

**Church Site â†’ Housing Assistance â†’ Everything Else**

If your framework can solve Pastor Evan's volunteer coordination problem, it can solve ANY domain where human expertise needs to be:
- **Accessible** (available 24/7)
- **Personal** (adapted to individual needs)  
- **Scalable** (one expert helping thousands)
- **Sustainable** (experts get compensated)

## Housing Assistance: The Next Domino

### The Current Broken System
- **Complex bureaucracy**: Maze of agencies, forms, requirements
- **Limited hours**: Help only available 9-5 weekdays
- **Overwhelmed staff**: Case workers with 100+ clients each
- **Lost knowledge**: When good case workers leave, their wisdom disappears
- **No personalization**: Same advice for different situations

### Your Wisdom Module Solution
```
