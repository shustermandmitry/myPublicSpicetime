# The Homeless Church - Your Solution Summary

## Immediate Problem You're Solving
- **Current site**: Hard to navigate, can't find volunteer info, donation is unclear
- **Result**: Missing volunteers because people can't figure out how to help

## Technical Architecture You've Built

### Zero-Maintenance Design

- **No servers**: Everything runs client-side or on Telegram
- **No accounts**: Just Telegram permissions for staff

### AI Agent System
- **Local AI**: Tiny models in browser IndexedDB (25-75MB)
- **Personal learning**: Each user gets their own agent that learns their context
- **Telegram integration**: Agent persists across sessions if user has Telegram
- **Chat widget**: Works without Telegram, enhanced with it

### Progressive Enhancement
1. **Anyone**: Can use website + basic AI help
2. **Telegram users**: Get persistent AI + community features  
3. **Staff**: Manage everything through Telegram channels they know
